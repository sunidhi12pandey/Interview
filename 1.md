# Project Architecture & Deployment Workflow

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **microservices-based application** deployed on **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**. It combines modern frontend technologies with scalable backend services and is designed to support seamless, secure, and resilient deployments.

- **Frontend**: Built using **React** and **Angular**, exposed through a **Google HTTPS Load Balancer**.  
- **Backend**: **Node.js microservices**, containerized and orchestrated with Kubernetes.  
- **Database**: **Google Cloud SQL** for relational data storage.  
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Centralized logging and observability with the **ELK stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).  

---

## 👩‍💻 My Role  
I manage the **infrastructure and deployments** with a strong focus on **automation, scalability, and reliability**:  

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Provisioning and managing infrastructure using **Terraform**.  
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Building, testing, and deploying code via **GitHub Actions**.  
- **Release Management:** Designing and implementing branching, promotion, and zero-downtime deployment strategies.  
- **Automation:** Infrastructure tasks like VM provisioning, secret management, and image hardening.

## 🌿 Branching & Release Strategy  
We follow an **environment-based branching strategy** aligned with our release promotion flow:  

- **`dev` branch** – Initial feature releases. Docker Compose-based deployments for fast validation.  
- **`stg` branch** – Promoted after 1 day. Hybrid setup: some apps still dockerized, others on GKE.  
- **`npr` branch** – Promoted after 3 days. Full GKE deployment, mirrors production closely.  
- **`prd` branch** – Promoted after 7 days of stability testing. Production-grade release on GKE.  

This staggered flow ensures:  
✅ Issues are caught early.  
✅ Workloads are validated across multiple setups.  
✅ Stable production rollouts with reduced risk.

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions)  

We run **two key pipelines** to ensure reliable delivery and automation:  

### 1. **Release Pipeline (Zero Downtime, Rolling Upgrade)**  
Purpose: Safely deploy application code with **no downtime**.  

**Stages:**  
1. **Code Commit & PR Validation**  
   - Developer pushes to branch.  
   - PR raised → pipeline runs code vulnerability scans (via **Wiz**) and builds the application.  

2. **Build & Local Testing**  
   - Application dockerized using **Docker Compose**.  
   - Health checks run (HTTP 200 expected).  

3. **Image Push & Security Scan**  
   - Validated images pushed to **Artifact Registry**.  
   - Second container scan (Wiz) ensures compliance.  

4. **Deployment (Rolling Upgrade)**  
   - Pipeline clones release code.  
   - Uses **rolling upgrades in Kubernetes** → ensures **zero downtime** in production.  

---

### 2. **Automation Pipeline**  
Purpose: Manage **infrastructure automation and housekeeping**.  

**Examples:**  
- Provisioning VMs and applying environment labels.  
- Managing **secrets** across environments.  
- Clearing **caches** during release cycles.  
- Hardening **custom images** to enhance security.  
- Creating **snapshots & volumes** for backup and recovery.

## ✅ Key Takeaways  
- Fully **cloud-native microservices architecture**.  
- **Terraform + GitHub Actions** drive automation and consistency.  
- **Environment-based branching** enables smooth staged rollouts.  
- **Zero-downtime deployments** ensure uninterrupted user experience.
