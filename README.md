# Interview

**Tell me about yourself**

Hi, my name is Sunidhi Pandey, and I have cummulative 4 plus years of experience in the IT industry and relevent experinece in  DevOps field is 3 years  i. My journey began at Hastree Technologies, where I worked as a Cloud Engineer. My main responsibilities involved deploying and managing cloud infrastructure. During this time, I gained strong hands-on experience with cloud platforms like Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and AWS, and developed a solid understanding of VPCs, container registries, and IAM.
Currently, I’m working as a Software Engineer at WhizHack Technologies, where my focus is on automation and application deployment. Here, I’ve deepened my experience with tools like GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes, as well as bash scripting and working in Linux environments.
Over the years, I’ve developed a strong foundation in cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and system automation. I'm passionate about solving problems, improving deployment efficiency, and working on scalable cloud solutions.

***Roles & Responsibilities***


In my current role as a DevOps Engineer, my responsibilities are mainly focused around cloud infrastructure management, CI/CD automation, and application deployment and support.

1) Cloud Platform Management:
I’m responsible for building and managing cloud infrastructure using platforms like GCP and AWS. This includes setting up and configuring VPCs, virtual machines, and firewall rules to ensure secure and scalable environments. I also manage users and permissions through IAM policies and handle private container registries for storing and accessing Docker images securely. These tasks are essential to ensure that our infrastructure is reliable, secure, and well-organized.

2) CI/CD Pipeline Automation:
I design and implement CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, which helps our teams to automate code testing, build, and deployment. I also actively look for repetitive or manual tasks and automate them to save time and reduce the chances of human error. This has helped speed up our development cycles and improve consistency in deployments.

3) Deployment Management:
I manage deployments across four environments — dev, QA, staging, and production — for over 5 products and 15+ services. We use Docker and Kubernetes for containerized deployments. I ensure deployments are smooth and consistent across all environments, and that updates are delivered without downtime or service impact.

4) Troubleshooting & Support:
I also handle production issue troubleshooting. This includes analyzing logs, identifying root causes, and fixing issues quickly to minimize downtime. This responsibility is critical for maintaining application reliability and ensuring smooth user experiences.

****How do you start your day as a DevOps Engineer?****

 I typically begin my day by:

1) Checking Monitoring Dashboards and Alerts:
I first check system monitoring tools and alert channels — like email, Slack, or ELK dashboards — to ensure that all services are running smoothly and there are no critical issues in production or other environments.

2)Reviewing CI/CD Pipelines:
I go through the status of recent builds and deployments using GitHub Actions. If any pipeline has failed, I investigate the cause and take necessary actions to fix it quickly.

3) Daily Stand-up Meeting:
    If there’s a daily stand-up or team sync meeting, I join to align with developers, QA, or other team members on the current tasks, priorities, and any blockers.

4)Checking Pending Tickets or Tasks:
  I review my assigned tickets in Jira or the task board in teams shift app and plan my work for the day — whether it’s infrastructure changes, automation tasks, deployment requests, or troubleshooting issues.

5) Prioritizing Automation or Ongoing Work:
Once urgent checks are done, I focus on ongoing work like improving CI/CD pipelines, writing automation scripts, managing cloud infrastructure, or deploying new services to our environments.
